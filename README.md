# MATLAB-ALGORITHMS
Matlab have these function init.But i have done reverse engineering and write these algorithms.

1)LINEAR CONVOLUTION
2)CIRCULAR CONVOLUTION
3)DISCRETE FOURIER TRANSFORM
4)INVERSE DISCRETE FOURIER TRANSFORM

you can just run these algorithms files in Matlab and then program will asked to enter the sequences.When after entering the sequences hit Enter button then it will give you the result and graphical diagram.
